-> A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes/vertices and edges.
-> The mathematical expression of a graph is G = (V,E)
    G=graph
    V=No. of vertices
    E=No. of edges
-> A graph in which the directions of the edges are mentioned is called a directed graph. Otherwise, the graph is called an undirected graph.
-> Directions of the edges of a directed graph are unidirectional, and those of the edges of an undirected graph are bi-directional.
-> The edges of an undirected graph have no direction indication. Hence, they are considered bi-directional.
-> A weighted graph is a graph with value-assigned edges. The opposite is called unweighted.
-> A graph having cycle(s) is a cyclic graph. The opposite is acyclic. (Cyclic means a path starting from a node ends at the same node.)
-> Tree is an example of an acyclic graph.
-> Terms related to graph:
    - Adjacent/Neighbor nodes: Two nodes connected through a single edge.
    - Path: Sequence of nodes, each pair of nodes being connected through an edge.
        * Length of a path: The length of a path refers to the no. of edges.
        * Simple path: A path with no repeating node.
        * Closed path: A path having the same node as its starting and ending node.
    - Cycle: A path starting from and ending at the same node, the other nodes being distinct.
    - Connected graph: A graph having a path to reach a node from any other node. The opposite is called a disconnected graph.
    - Strongly connected graph: A directed graph having a directed path to reach a node from any other node. The opposite is called a weakly connected graph.
    - Degree of a node: The no. of edges connected to a node in an undirected graph.
    - Indegree of a node: The no. of edges ending at a node in a directed graph.
    - Outdegree of a node: The no. of edges starting from a node in a directed graph.
    - Complete graph: A graph having an edge between each pair of nodes.
