-> A binary tree has less than or equal to 2 nodes.
-> Full binary tree is a type of binary tree where each node has 0 or 2 nodes.
-> Complete binary tree is a type of binary tree where-
   1) all the nodes in the levels except the last level have 2 nodes each,
   2) the nodes in the last level are the children of the leftmost nodes of the previous levels (for example, if there are 2 nodes in the level before the last level being numbered as 1 and 2 from the left, then either a) node 1 can have 1 node at its left (node 2 must be empty in this case), or b) node 1 can have 2 nodes, as well as node 2 can have 1 node at left, 2 nodes or no node at all.)
-> In a Perfect binary tree, all the nodes before the last level have 2 nodes each and all the leaf nodes are in the same level.
-> In a Balanced binary tree, the absolute difference between the heights of the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree of each node is at most 1.
-> Pathological (or Degenerate) binary is where each parent node has only 1 child node.
-> Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree with the following properties:
   1) Each of the node values of the left sub-tree will be less than the root node value,
   2) Each of the node values of the right sub-tree will be greater than the root node value,
   3) Each of the sub-trees will be a BST as well.
-> BST traversal:
   1) Pre-order traversal: node -> left sub-tree -> right sub-tree
   2) In-order traversal: left sub-tree -> node -> right sub-tree
