-> A binary tree has less than or equal to 2 nodes.
-> Full binary tree is a type of binary tree where each node has 0 or 2 nodes.
-> Complete binary tree is a type of binary tree where-
   1) all the nodes in the levels except the last level must have 2 nodes each,
   2) the nodes in the last level must be the children of the leftmost nodes of the previous levels (for example, if there are 2 nodes in the level before the last level being
      numbered as 1 and 2 from the left, then either a) node 1 can have 1 node at its left (node 2 must be empty in this case), or b) node 1 can have 2 nodes, as well as node 2
		  can have 1 node at left, 2 nodes or no node at all.)
